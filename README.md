tt
======
tt is a simple time tracker. It allows CLI input of start, stop, pause, and resume events as well as reporting on time.

There are many time trackers in the world, this is just an exercise to scratch an itch in a language I need to use more often. You shouldn't use it for billable purposes, and you shouldn't rely on it working consistently. You've been warned.
